# The Gains Lab - React App

This is a work in progress for The Gains Lab - Engine app.

### Goals:

1. Create a React App for the Engine App
   1. Backend: Postgres (integrate with existing database)
   2. Frontend: React
2. Be able to expand the app to be a home base for all other gains lab apps based on permissions
3. Add Stripe payments?
4. Mobile App?
5. Maybe think about switching gears and making an [Electron App](https://www.electronjs.org/) that will always be a web app -- then we wont have to deal with apple/google subscriptions
